Scenario Outline: Alerting API Test for Alerting 1.0 Condition 

Given I trigger CREATE Alert API request on Alert MS for "<TestCaseRow>"
Then I verify API response from Alert MS
Then I trigger UPDATE Alert API request on Alert MS
Then I verify API response from Alert MS for UPDATE Request
Then I trigger DELETE API request on Alert MS
Then I verify API response from Alert MS for DELETE Request
Then I get ITSM Simulator Response for Current Alert
Then I verify If all requests were sent to ITSM

|TestCaseRow|
|ALerting 1.0|
|Alerting 1.0 with ResourceID as EndPointID|

Given I trigger CREATE Alert API request on Alert MS for "<TestCaseRow1>"
Then I verify API response from Alert MS
Then I trigger UPDATE Alert API request on Alert MS
Then I verify API response from Alert MS for UPDATE Request
Then I trigger CREATE Alert API request on Alert MS for "<TestCaseRow2>"
Then I verify New Alert created for New Request
Then I trigger UPDATE Alert API request on Alert MS
Then I verify API response from Alert MS for UPDATE Request
Then I trigger DELETE API request on Alert MS
Then I verify API response from Alert MS for DELETE Request
Then I get ITSM Simulator Response for Current Alert
Then I verify If all requests were sent to ITSM

Examples:
|TestCaseRow1|TestCaseRow2|
|Alerting 1.0 with LegacyAlertID|Alerting 1.0 with New LegacyAlertID|
